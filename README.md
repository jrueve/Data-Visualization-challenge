Data Visualization Homework

there are 249 mice total
most underwent Capomulin drug treatment and Ramicane.
There was roughly an equal amount of male and female mice

Based on Box and whisker plots of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest Final tumor volume in mice tested, and Ramicane may even be statistically significantlly better at lowering tumor volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin. Thing to note was that Infubinol had one point of data that was an ouliter to the data.

Line plot shows tumor volume decrease over time with a mouse on Capomulin.
Based on the scatterplot the size of the tumor and weight of the mouse have a positive linear relationship with a correlation value of 0.84 for line of best fit to the data. So a pretty high correlation between the two variables.
